# gas-get: DEPLOYED
A full React.js application that displays gas stations in you area based off your current location in addition it can find your vehicles combined MPG rating. This application uses my previously created API called get-gas-api(https://github.com/FicusCarica308/get-gas-api)

## Project Objective:
This project was originally supposed to be a application that finds the cheapest gas station based on miles traveled/price. Eventually I realized getting gas station prices was gonna be impossible for a small portfolio project so I abandoned the feature. However the project retains the ability to display the combination(City/Highway) MPG of a vehicle and gas stations in you area.

### Technologies:
* React.js 

## Learning Objectives:
* Practice building react components
* Gain a deeper understanding of component state & lifecycles
* Explore using the google maps API in React
* Explore CORS security between API and web application
* Deeper understand of the MERN stack and its capabilities
* Understanding .env with using create-react-app

#### Other:
The project requires process.env vairables 
* REACT_APP_GET_GAS_API_KEY - dev key required to access data of my get-gas-api
* REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY - A google maps API key
